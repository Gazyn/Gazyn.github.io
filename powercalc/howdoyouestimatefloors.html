<p>Let's say you run the power calculator when you have a top floor of 1200 and get a result of 6.93e15 power.<br>
You do some resets, grind for a few days and run it again, this time getting a result of 3.26e16 power.<br>
This means you have gotten 3.26e16/6.93e15=~4.8 times more power than the last time you ran the calculator.</p>

<p>Enter this into the floor estimation as just 4.8 and you'll get an estimate of how many floors you could gain.<br>
In this case, you would get 40 - 53 floors gained, which means you could reach floor 1240-1253, without considering<br>
some ambigous variables such as soldier walls, 100-floors, accuracy of power calculation, effort and time.</p>

also if you don't use relative increase and just put your actual power in there you're pretty much making something out of nothing. the code isn't complex enough to give an accurate answer on such a large scale :p
